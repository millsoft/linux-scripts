#subl

Here is an alternative to the command line launcher for sublime text.
The provided `subl` launcher starts sublime text but in the background.
This one starts sublime text and brings it to the front.

This is still work in progress, sometimes it doesn't work as expected but I am
still working on it. If you can help please leave me a note.

### Installation

Just replace the subl script with this one, make sure it is still executable.
Usually subl is here:  `/usr/bin/subl`  but you can use `whereis subl` to find
it.

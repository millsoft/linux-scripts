# umountx
unmout a mouted device by a partial string.
Why? I work with ffshs a lot, when I mount a remote server the path is
ridiculously long. With that script I can just type `umountx somename` to umout
it by a partial string.

Ifthe script finds the mount point it will ask you for a confirmation first, so
don't worry (and be happy) ;)
